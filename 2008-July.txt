Subject: [dreamchess-devel] Problems when run on an embedded system
Message-ID: <BC1FF0FF51214A748C90BD0508001C06@thinkpadserg>

Hi, 

I've ported dreachess 0.2 to an ARM9 embedded system.
The configuation of system is as follows:
ARM9, color depth 16bit (565), screen size 480*272
OpenGL support: OSMesa 7.0.3 configured as linux-osmesa configuration, pure SW rendering
SDL 1.2.13 configured to use fbdev video driver and automatically create opengl context

The game starts well but the graphis is messed up.
The fonts are in bluecolors and unreadable. When I manage to go to the board view, in 3D view the figues are also blue, whole image has a lot of blue color.

I tried to compile all under X using mesa pure sw rendering.
The result was better but thjere are still artifacts, like there is no board image in board view, etc.

Are there any trick to compile dreamchess with osmesa and pure sw 3d rendering ? Maybe I need to use specific OSMesa version ?

Because all the avvailable open-source FICS clients are
2d and a bit plain, it wowd be nice if you could add
FICS support
